    <h1>How to Apply for UK University Scholarships</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
      <p>Scholarship deadlines are usually many months prior to the start of the course. So, you need to apply for a course of study at the university before you can try for the scholarships.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Steps to Start Search -->
    <section id="steps">
      <h2>Steps to Start Your Search</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Search the course database for the subject you are interested in and save your results.</li>
        <li>When you have shortlisted a few courses, check the profiles of selected universities to get more details.</li>
        <li>Visit the university websites of your choice and search for scholarships for international students.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Considerations -->
    <section id="considerations">
      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <p>All UK scholarships are not offered based on financial need; most of them will evaluate your academic ability.</p>
      <p>You can apply for scholarships when you are applying for the course at the university or after you have applied.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Scholarship Deadline -->
    <section id="deadline">
      <h2>Scholarships Deadline</h2>
      <p>There are numerous scholarships available for students aiming to attend a UK University, especially international students. However, many universities set a deadline for applications quite early in the year, as there would be hundreds of applicants, and hence it is advisable to start early.</p>
