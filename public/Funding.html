    <h2>Where Do These Grants Come From?</h2>
    <p>Registered charitable organisations across the UK give grants to assist people in need.<br> Grants are given to people based on their personal circumstances, for example, a job you've worked at or a health condition you may have.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Apply?</h2>
    <p>Everyone can apply for a grant and many charities will help people who cannot claim welfare benefits because of their status in the UK. We can’t guarantee you’ll get a grant but we can show you what you could apply for.</p>

    <h2>How Will I Be Paid?</h2>
    <p>Each fund’s payment methods will be specific to them. Grants can be given as money, products,<br> or services that don't have to be paid back.</p>

    <h2>When Will I Receive an Answer?</h2>
    <p>Each fund has a different timeframe. This can range anywhere from 5 days to 3 months. Where we have this information, we show it in the grant fund details.</p>

    <h2>Before You Start</h2>
    <p>Remember, all your answers are private and never shared with anyone. The more information you put into the tool, the better the chance of finding grants you could be eligible for.</p>
    
    <p>When answering the Grants Search questions, it is important to remember that you can consider the situations of either yourself, your partner, or your immediate family members.</p>
    
    <p>For example, if an employment or health question does not apply to you personally, you might qualify for a certain grant because of your immediate family member’s work or health situation – even if they are no longer alive.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Partner refers to someone you are married to, have a civil partnership with or live with as a couple.</li>
      <li>Immediate family member means your partner, parents or dependent children.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can skip any of the questions while filling out the Grants Search, however the more information you include will increase the number of grants we can match you with.</p>
